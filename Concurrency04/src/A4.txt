Remarks:
We see that the standard algorithm performs faster for 4 and 8 threads. This is probably because retraversing the list takes a longer time than waiting for acquiring a lock. On the other hand, for only 2 threads, the optimistic approach performs better than the standard approach. In the case of a low number of threads Ð and therefore a lower number of retraversals of the list Ð the time used for retraversal seems to be smaller than the time spent on waiting for other locks to be released.
